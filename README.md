# Overview

I work as a accounting assisant and a month ago I applied to a great job position. It was something I already knew and I am used to, but they required me to know R. I didnt know what R was, then I searched a little and found it was a programing language specialized for statistics. I could not get the job. Nevertheless, I decided to use this time to learn the basics of R so, eventually, I would practice it more and be prepare to apply again.  

I desired to learned the basics. The sintaxis... how to create variable, how to perform functions, loops, conditionals, and more. I even wanted to learned how to use its main functions for statistic. This is what this program is about To apply the basic of R and output a statistic function.
